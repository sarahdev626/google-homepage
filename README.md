This is the HTML/CSS Front End project. I will be using HTML and CSS to construct a clone of the Google Homepage! I will also be building the site with Visual Studio Code, and using git to upload the finished code to GitHub. 

I have some experience with HTML and CSS at this point, but git, VS Code and GitHub are all still really new. 

Here we go!!!

Finished! I'm happy with the results. It's a pretty basic creation without a lot of function, but it was still a challenge. I had to google a lot of things and watch some YouTube videos for refreshers, but most of the questions I had, I was able to figure out.
